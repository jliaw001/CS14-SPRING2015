Is your selectionsort function a stable sort?
a. My selection sort should be stable since I use an iterator to keep track of the smallest value (it2) and
   another iterator that actually moves through the container to find the smallest value (it3). It3 moves
   through the container comparing its value with it2 and if the value is less, then it2 gets moved to wherever
   it3 was and this becomes the new smallest value. However, if the two values were equal, it2 stays where it is
   and when it's time to swap, it simply swaps with itself, not moving anything and mainting the general order.
